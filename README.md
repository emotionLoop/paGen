# paGen â€” Password Generator by emotionLoop

Current version: 1.0.3

Help & Support: http://emotionloop.com

paGen is a Google Chrome extension, that will help you by generating random passwords.

We wanted a simple and easy to use password generator for Google Chrome, and we couldn't find it, so we built one.

It has a simple and easy to use interface.

## Installation

You can install and rate it on Google's Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pagen/eligfkfpdmeloopcoighgpdgedhnoool

## Features

* Free!
* Clutter-free interface
* Enhanced security (includes Special characters and more punctuation characters than most similar extensions)
* Sync-enabled settings
* Desktop notifications-enabled messages (when saving settings or an error occurs)
* Retina-ready
* No jQuery (it's not going to run in Internet Explorer, right?)
* CoffeeScript (oh yeah!)
* LESS (likewise!)
* Multi-language support (only English comes bundled, but you're welcome to add more languages and send them our way)
* Adobe Fireworks editable images

## Repository file structure

- /code/ is where all the files, including CoffeeScript, LESS, and Fireworks editable images are (which don't go in the zip).

- /publish/ is where the zip and publish-ready files are, which don't include CoffeeScript files, LESS files, nor Fireworks editable images.
